A Message From Our VP, Jack Suess
</h1>
<p>

Dear UMBC Community,

It is my firm belief that UMBC students will never experience another time in their lives when so many are dedicated to their success. At UMBC, we are committed to helping our students become information seekers, problem solvers, opportunity creators, and community builders.
Recently, I was asked to describe the five most prominent attributes that we cultivate in our students at the UMBC School, and the following traits came to mind:

Respectful

Students exhibit respect for each other and for diverse views and backgrounds. They also demonstrate integrity and intellectual honesty in their academic work.

Innovative

Our students break new ground in the cultivation and implementation of new ideas.

Intellectual

They embrace the discipline of critical thinking, and appreciate rigorous and evidence-based decision making.

Influential

Smith students communicate their personal brand effectively, in part because they pair their life goals with concrete actions to stand out from the crowd.

Global

An international worldview leads to a better understanding of business and how itâ€™s conducted both abroad and domestically. Our global programs provide a valuable cornerstone to a well-rounded business education.

One of our primary goals at UMBC is to nurture the innate talents of our students with opportunities to develop and demonstrate these core values. As they move through the different stages of the UMBC Journey, it is our hope that they gain new appreciation for the returns these aspects of their education yield.

Sincerely,

</p>
